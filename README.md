# Instructions:

To run, ensure you have the pgzrun library installed and run like any old .py

To move forward, press up
To turn use left and right
To slow down, press down or crash into a wall.

Once everyone has "passed" the finish line, restart the program to have another go

I only had half a week and it was the second half so I was extremely tired because of this the cars sort of vibrate when they touch eachother, making it very easy for you to win.
